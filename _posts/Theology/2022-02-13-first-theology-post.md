“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes
in him should not perish but have eternal life.

For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in
order that the world might be saved through him.  Whoever believes in
him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already,
because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  And
this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the
darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For
everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the
light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true
comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been
carried out in God.”
